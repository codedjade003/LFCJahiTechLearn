# LFC Jahi Tech Learn - Fixes Summary

## Date: January 16, 2025

### Issues Addressed

#### 1. ✅ File Upload Issues Fixed

**Problem**: PDF/document uploads had double file extensions and were uploading as raw files.

**Solution**:
- Fixed Cloudinary configuration in `server/config/cloudinary.js`
  - Removed duplicate extension in `public_id`
  - Added `format` parameter to preserve file type
- Updated assignment and project controllers to properly handle materials
  - `server/controllers/courseController.js`: Fixed `addAssignment`, `updateAssignment`, `createProject`, `updateProject`, and `getProject` functions
  - Removed JSON stringification of materials (they're now stored as objects)

**Additional Fix (Jan 16, 2025 - 4:52 PM)**:
- Added parsing logic to handle materials if they arrive as stringified JSON
- Backend now accepts materials as both objects (preferred) or strings (fallback)
- Added debug logging to track material format

**Files Modified**:
- `server/config/cloudinary.js`
- `server/controllers/courseController.js` (updated with parsing logic)
