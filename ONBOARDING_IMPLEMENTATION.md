# Onboarding Feature Implementation Guide

## Overview
Implemented a comprehensive onboarding system using react-joyride that guides users through the app on their first visit to each page/feature.

## Features Implemented

### 1. **OnboardingContext** ✅
- Tracks onboarding progress per feature/page

**API Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/users/onboarding/complete` - Mark specific tour as complete

**Location:** `server/models/User.js`, `server/routes/userManagementRoutes.js`

### 3. **Reusable OnboardingTour Component** ✅

**Location:** `lfc-learning/src/pages/Dashboards/StudentDashboard.tsx`

## Remaining Tours to Implement

### Course Details Page
```typescript
const courseDetailsTourSteps: Step[] = [
  {
    target: "body",
    content: "Welcome to the course details page! Let's explore what you can do here.",
    placement: "center",
  },
  {
    target: '[data-tour="course-info"]',
    content: "Here you'll find the course description, instructor info, and learning objectives.",
    placement: "bottom",
  },
  {
    target: '[data-tour="course-content"]',
    content: "Browse through all course modules and sections here. Click on any module to start learning.",
    placement: "right",
  },
  {
    target: '[data-tour="enroll-button"]',
    content: "Click here to enroll in the course and start your learning journey!",
    placement: "bottom",
  },
];
```

### Admin Dashboard
```typescript
const adminDashboardTourSteps: Step[] = [
  {
    target: "body",
    content: "Welcome to the Admin Dashboard! Let's show you around.",
    placement: "center",
  },
  {
    target: '[data-tour="stats"]',

    placement: "bottom",
  },
  {

    content: "Track recent user activities and system events here.",
    placement: "top",
  },
  {
    target: '[data-tour="pending-assessments"]',
    content: "View and manage pending assignments, projects, and quizzes that need grading.",
    placement: "left",
  },
];
```

### Course Management
```typescript
const courseManagementTourSteps: Step[] = [
  {
    target: '[data-tour="create-course"]',
    content: "Click here to create a new course.",
    placement: "bottom",
  },
  {
    target: '[data-tour="course-list"]',
    content: "All your courses are listed here. Click on any course to edit or view details.",
    placement: "top",
  },
  {
    target: '[data-tour="course-filters"]',
    content: "Use filters to quickly find specific courses by status, category, or level.",
    placement: "bottom",
  },
];
```

### Assessment Grading
```typescript
const assessmentGradingTourSteps: Step[] = [
  {
    target: '[data-tour="pending-list"]',
    content: "All pending submissions are listed here, organized by due date.",
    placement: "right",
  },
  {
    target: '[data-tour="grade-submission"]',

  },
  {
    target: '[data-tour="bulk-actions"]',
    content: "Use bulk actions to grade multiple submissions at once.",
    placement: "top",
  },
];
```

## Implementation Steps for Remaining Tours

### For Each Page:

1. **Import Dependencies:**
```typescript
import OnboardingTour from "../../components/shared/OnboardingTour";
import type { Step } from "react-joyride";
```

2. **Define Tour Steps:**
```typescript
const tourSteps: Step[] = [
  // ... steps
];
```

3. **Add OnboardingTour Component:**
```typescript
<OnboardingTour tourKey="pageName" steps={tourSteps} />
```

4. **Add data-tour Attributes:**
```typescript
<div data-tour="element-name">
  {/* Content */}
</div>
```

## Integration with First Login

The onboarding system is designed to work seamlessly with the existing first login flow:

1. **User logs in for the first time** → `firstLogin: true`
2. **OnboardingContext loads** → Checks `onboardingProgress`
3. **User navigates to a page** → Tour shows if not completed
4. **User completes/skips tour** → Progress saved to backend
5. **All tours completed** → `isOnboarded: true`

## Key Features

### ✅ Automatic Triggering

- No manual triggering required

### ✅ Persistent Progress

### ✅ Skippable

## Styling

Tours use LFC branding:

- Accent Color: `#F6BE00` (LFC Gold)
- Clean, modern design
