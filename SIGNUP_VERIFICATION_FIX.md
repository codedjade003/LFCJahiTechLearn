# Signup & Verification Flow Fix

## Date: October 17, 2025

## Problem Identified

Users reported that after signing up, they would be redirected to the verification page, but it would flash and immediately redirect back to the sign-in page. This created confusion and caused double verification requests.

### Root Cause

The issue was in the verification flow logic:

1. **User signs up** → Receives token and `isVerified: false` is stored in localStorage
2. **Navigates to `/verify-email`** → Verification page loads
3. **User enters code and verifies** → Backend marks email as verified
4. **Problem:** After verification, the code navigated to `/` (login page) but:
   - The user already had a token from signup
   - `isVerified` in localStorage was still `false` (not updated)
   - This could cause redirect loops or confusion

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Update `isVerified` in localStorage After Verification ✅

**File: `lfc-learning/src/components/VerifyEmail.tsx`**

After successful verification, we now:
- Update `localStorage.setItem("isVerified", "true")`
- Check if user has a token (from signup)
- If token exists, auto-login them to the appropriate dashboard
- If no token, send them to login page

**Before:**
```typescript
// ✅ Verified now, send to login
navigate("/");
```

**After:**
```typescript
// ✅ Update verification status in localStorage
localStorage.setItem("isVerified", "true");

// ✅ Check if user has a token (from signup)
const token = localStorage.getItem("token");

if (token) {
  // User signed up and has token - auto-login them
  const role = localStorage.getItem("role");

  // Navigate to appropriate dashboard
  if (role === "admin" || role === "admin-only") {
    navigate("/admin/dashboard");
  } else {
    navigate("/dashboard");
  }
} else {
  // No token - send to login page
  navigate("/");
}
```

### 2. Store User Role During Signup ✅

**File: `lfc-learning/src/components/SignUpForm.tsx`**

Added role storage during signup so the verification page knows where to redirect:

```typescript
localStorage.setItem("role", data.role || "student");
```

## New Flow

### Scenario 1: New User Signup
1. User fills signup form and submits
2. Backend creates account with `isVerified: false`
3. Frontend stores: `token`, `role`, `firstLogin`, `isOnboarded`, `isVerified: false`
4. User is redirected to `/verify-email?email=user@example.com`
5. Verification code is automatically sent
6. User enters 6-digit code
7. Backend verifies code and marks email as verified
8. Frontend updates `isVerified: true` in localStorage
9. **User is automatically logged in** and redirected to dashboard
10. ✅ No need to login again!

### Scenario 2: Existing User Trying to Login (Unverified)
1. User tries to login
2. Backend returns `EMAIL_NOT_VERIFIED` error
3. Frontend redirects to `/verify-email?email=user@example.com`
4. User enters code and verifies
5. Frontend updates `isVerified: true`
6. **No token exists** (login was rejected)
7. User is redirected to `/` (login page)
8. User can now login successfully

## Benefits

✅ **No more redirect loops** - `isVerified` is properly updated after verification
✅ **Better UX** - Users don't need to login again after verifying email
✅ **Automatic login** - Seamless transition from signup → verify → dashboard
✅ **No double verification requests** - Clear flow prevents confusion
✅ **Proper role-based routing** - Admin users go to admin dashboard, students to student dashboard

## Files Modified

1. **`lfc-learning/src/components/VerifyEmail.tsx`**
   - Updated `handleVerify()` function
   - Added localStorage update for `isVerified`
   - Added auto-login logic with role-based routing

2. **`lfc-learning/src/components/SignUpForm.tsx`**
   - Added `role` storage in localStorage during signup
   - Fixed line endings (Windows → Unix)

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] New user signup flow
  - [ ] Sign up with valid email
  - [ ] Receive verification code
  - [ ] Enter code and verify
  - [ ] Automatically redirected to dashboard
  - [ ] No need to login again

- [ ] Existing unverified user login attempt
  - [ ] Try to login with unverified account
  - [ ] Redirected to verification page
  - [ ] Enter code and verify
  - [ ] Redirected to login page
  - [ ] Can now login successfully

- [ ] Admin user signup
  - [ ] Sign up as admin
  - [ ] Verify email
  - [ ] Automatically redirected to admin dashboard

## Technical Notes

### localStorage Keys Used
- `token` - JWT authentication token
- `role` - User role (student, admin, admin-only)
- `isVerified` - Email verification status (true/false)
- `firstLogin` - First time login flag
- `isOnboarded` - Onboarding completion status

### Protected Routes
The `ProtectedRoute` component checks:
1. Token exists (user is logged in)
2. `isVerified === "true"` (email is verified)
3. Role matches allowed roles (if specified)

If any check fails, user is redirected appropriately.
