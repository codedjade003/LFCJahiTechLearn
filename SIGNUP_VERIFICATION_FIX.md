# Signup & Verification Flow Fix

## Date: October 17, 2025

## Problem Identified

Users reported that after signing up, they would be redirected to the verification page, but it would **flash and immediately redirect back to the sign-in page**. This created confusion and caused double verification requests.

### Root Cause

The real issue was discovered in the server logs:

```
[REQ] GET /api/auth/me
JWT verification failed: jwt malformed
```

The problem flow:

1. **User signs up** â†’ Backend returns a token, frontend stores it in `localStorage`
2. **Navigates to `/verify-email`** â†’ Verification page loads
3. **AuthContext runs on mount** â†’ Calls `fetchUser()` which tries to validate the token
4. **Token validation fails** â†’ Backend returns 401 (token is for unverified user)
5. **AuthContext calls `logout()`** â†’ Clears token and redirects to `/` (login page)
6. **Result:** User is kicked off the verification page before they can verify!

The core issue: **Storing the token in localStorage before email verification** caused the AuthContext to try validating it, which failed and triggered an automatic logout/redirect.

## Solution Implemented

### Key Insight: Don't Store Token Until After Verification! ðŸ”‘

The solution is to **use sessionStorage as a temporary holding area** for the token and user data until email verification is complete.

### 1. Store Token in sessionStorage During Signup âœ…

**File: `lfc-learning/src/components/SignUpForm.tsx`**

**Before:**
```typescript
// Stored in localStorage immediately - BAD!
localStorage.setItem("token", data.token);
localStorage.setItem("role", data.role || "student");
// ... etc
```

**After:**
```typescript
if (!data.isVerified) {
  // Don't store token in localStorage yet - use sessionStorage
  sessionStorage.setItem("pendingToken", data.token);
  sessionStorage.setItem("pendingRole", data.role || "student");
  sessionStorage.setItem("pendingFirstLogin", JSON.stringify(data.firstLogin));
  sessionStorage.setItem("pendingIsOnboarded", JSON.stringify(data.isOnboarded));
  navigate(`/verify-email?email=${encodeURIComponent(email)}`);
}
```

**Why this works:**
- `sessionStorage` is NOT checked by AuthContext
- Token is safely stored but won't trigger authentication checks
- User can stay on verification page without being kicked out

### 2. Move Token to localStorage After Verification âœ…

**File: `lfc-learning/src/components/VerifyEmail.tsx`**

After successful verification:

```typescript
// Check if user has pending token from signup
const pendingToken = sessionStorage.getItem("pendingToken");

if (pendingToken) {
  // Move token from sessionStorage to localStorage
  localStorage.setItem("token", pendingToken);
  localStorage.setItem("role", sessionStorage.getItem("pendingRole") || "student");
  localStorage.setItem("firstLogin", sessionStorage.getItem("pendingFirstLogin") || "true");
  localStorage.setItem("isOnboarded", sessionStorage.getItem("pendingIsOnboarded") || "false");
  localStorage.setItem("isVerified", "true");
  
  // Clear pending data
  sessionStorage.removeItem("pendingToken");
  sessionStorage.removeItem("pendingRole");
  sessionStorage.removeItem("pendingFirstLogin");
  sessionStorage.removeItem("pendingIsOnboarded");
  
  // Auto-login to dashboard
  navigate("/dashboard");
} else {
  // Existing user verifying - send to login
  navigate("/");
}
```

## New Flow

### Scenario 1: New User Signup
1. User fills signup form and submits
2. Backend creates account with `isVerified: false` and returns token
3. **Frontend stores token in sessionStorage** (NOT localStorage) as `pendingToken`
4. User is redirected to `/verify-email?email=user@example.com`
5. Verification code is automatically sent
6. **AuthContext does NOT try to validate token** (it's not in localStorage)
7. User stays on verification page without being kicked out âœ…
8. User enters 6-digit code
9. Backend verifies code and marks email as verified
10. **Frontend moves token from sessionStorage to localStorage**
11. Frontend sets `isVerified: true` in localStorage
12. **User is automatically logged in** and redirected to dashboard
13. âœ… No need to login again!

### Scenario 2: Existing User Trying to Login (Unverified)
1. User tries to login
2. Backend returns `EMAIL_NOT_VERIFIED` error
3. Frontend redirects to `/verify-email?email=user@example.com`
4. User enters code and verifies
5. Frontend updates `isVerified: true`
6. **No token exists** (login was rejected)
7. User is redirected to `/` (login page)
8. User can now login successfully

## Benefits

âœ… **No more redirect loops** - Token is not in localStorage until after verification
âœ… **No more "flashing"** - User stays on verification page without being kicked out
âœ… **Better UX** - Users don't need to login again after verifying email
âœ… **Automatic login** - Seamless transition from signup â†’ verify â†’ dashboard
âœ… **No double verification requests** - Clear flow prevents confusion
âœ… **Proper role-based routing** - Admin users go to admin dashboard, students to student dashboard
âœ… **AuthContext doesn't interfere** - sessionStorage is not checked by authentication logic

## Files Modified

1. **`lfc-learning/src/components/VerifyEmail.tsx`**
   - Updated `handleVerify()` function
   - Added localStorage update for `isVerified`
   - Added auto-login logic with role-based routing

2. **`lfc-learning/src/components/SignUpForm.tsx`**
   - Added `role` storage in localStorage during signup
   - Fixed line endings (Windows â†’ Unix)

## Technical Notes

### Storage Keys Used

**localStorage** (checked by AuthContext):
- `token` - JWT authentication token (only stored AFTER verification)
- `role` - User role (student, admin, admin-only)
- `isVerified` - Email verification status (true/false)
- `firstLogin` - First time login flag
- `isOnboarded` - Onboarding completion status

**sessionStorage** (temporary, NOT checked by AuthContext):
- `pendingToken` - Token from signup, waiting for verification
- `pendingRole` - User role, waiting for verification
- `pendingFirstLogin` - First login flag, waiting for verification
- `pendingIsOnboarded` - Onboarding status, waiting for verification

### Protected Routes
The `ProtectedRoute` component checks:
1. Token exists (user is logged in)
2. `isVerified === "true"` (email is verified)
3. Role matches allowed roles (if specified)

If any check fails, user is redirected appropriately.
