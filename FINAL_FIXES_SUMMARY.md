# Final Fixes Summary

## âœ… Tour Precedence Fixed

### Problem
The dashboard tour wasn't showing before the onboarding modal, and sometimes wasn't showing at all.

### Root Cause
Users who had already completed the tour (`progress.dashboard = true`) wouldn't see it again, even if they hadn't completed the onboarding modal.

### Solution

**1. Force Tour for Users Without Onboarding**
Modified `OnboardingContext.tsx` to reset the dashboard tour progress if the user hasn't seen onboarding:

```typescript
// In fetchProgress()
if (!data.hasSeenOnboarding && userProgress.dashboard) {
  userProgress = { ...userProgress, dashboard: false };
}
```

**2. Updated Modal Display Logic**
The modal now only shows after the tour completes:

```typescript
// Show onboarding modal after tour completes OR if tour is disabled
useEffect(() => {
  if (!isInitialLoading && profile && !onboardingDismissed) {
    if (!profile.hasSeenOnboarding) {
      if (progress.dashboard) {
        // Tour completed, show modal after short delay
        setTimeout(() => setShowOnboarding(true), 500);
      }
    }
  }
}, [isInitialLoading, profile, progress.dashboard, onboardingDismissed]);
```

### Flow Now
1. **User logs in** â†’ Dashboard loads
2. **Tour starts automatically** (if not completed)
3. **User completes/skips tour** â†’ `progress.dashboard` becomes `true`
4. **Modal appears** (if `hasSeenOnboarding` is `false`)
5. **User completes/skips modal** â†’ `hasSeenOnboarding` becomes `true`
6. **Neither tour nor modal appear again**

## âœ… Email Logging Added

### Problem
Concern about multiple verification emails being sent on signup.

### Investigation
- Checked `registerUser` controller - only sends one email
- Checked `resendVerification` endpoint - separate endpoint, not called automatically
- Checked `sendEmail` utility - only sends once
- Checked User model hooks - no email sending
- Checked middleware - no email sending

### Solution
Added comprehensive logging to track email sending:

**Register Endpoint:**
```javascript
console.log("=== REGISTER USER REQUEST ===");
console.log("Timestamp:", new Date().toISOString());
console.log("Email:", req.body.email);
console.log("Sending verification email to:", email);
console.log("Verification email sent successfully");
```

**Resend Verification Endpoint:**
```javascript
console.log("=== RESEND VERIFICATION REQUEST ===");
console.log("Timestamp:", new Date().toISOString());
console.log("Email:", req.body.email);
console.log("Sending verification code to:", email);
console.log("Verification code sent successfully");
```

### Monitoring
To check for duplicate emails:
```bash
tail -f /tmp/server.log | grep -E "REGISTER|RESEND|verification email"
```

You'll see:
```
=== REGISTER USER REQUEST ===
Timestamp: 2025-10-16T21:13:00.000Z
Email: user@example.com
Sending verification email to: user@example.com
ðŸ“§ Email (default) sent to user@example.com: re_abc123
Verification email sent successfully
```

If you see multiple "REGISTER USER REQUEST" logs for the same email within seconds, that indicates a client-side issue (double form submission).

## Testing Checklist

### Tour & Modal Flow
- [ ] New user logs in
- [ ] Dashboard tour starts automatically
- [ ] User can complete tour with "Finish" button
- [ ] User can skip tour with "Skip Tour" button
- [ ] After tour completes, modal appears
- [ ] User can complete modal with "Finish Setup"
- [ ] User can skip modal with "Skip for now"
- [ ] Neither tour nor modal appear on subsequent logins

### Email Verification
- [ ] Register new user
- [ ] Check server logs for single "REGISTER USER REQUEST"
- [ ] Check email for verification code
- [ ] Verify no duplicate emails received
- [ ] Test "Resend Code" button
- [ ] Check server logs for "RESEND VERIFICATION REQUEST"
- [ ] Verify only one resend email received

---

## Server Logs

### Monitor Tour & Modal
```bash
tail -f /tmp/server.log | grep -i onboarding
```

### Monitor Email Sending
```bash
tail -f /tmp/server.log | grep -E "REGISTER|RESEND|Email.*sent"
```

### Monitor All Activity
```bash
tail -f /tmp/server.log
```

## Notes

- Tour will now show for all users who haven't completed onboarding
- Modal only appears after tour completes
- All email sending is logged with timestamps
- No code changes were needed to fix duplicate emails (none found)
- If duplicate emails occur, check client-side for double form submissions
