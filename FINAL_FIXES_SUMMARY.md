### 2. Signup/Verification Flow - Clarified ✅

#### Current Flow (Correct & Secure):
```
1. User signs up
2. Backend creates account (isVerified: false)
3. Backend sends verification email
4. Frontend clears all storage
5. User redirected to /verify-email
6. User enters 6-digit code
7. Backend marks email as verified
8. Frontend clears storage and redirects to /?verified=true
9. Login page shows success message
10. User logs in manually
```

**Why no auto-login?** Backend doesn't return token on verification (security best practice). User must manually login after verification.

### 3. Email System - Consolidated & Rate Limited ✅

#### Fixed Double Email Issue:
**Before:** Two different formats
- Register: "Your verification code is: 123456"
- Resend: "Your code is: 123456"

**After:** Single format
- Both: "Your verification code is: 123456"
- Subject: "Verify Your Email - LFC Tech Learn"
- From: noreply@lfctechlearn.com

#### Rate Limiting:
- **1 minute gap** between requests
- **5 requests maximum** per hour
- Automatic cleanup of old timestamps

**Error Messages:**
- "Please wait X seconds before requesting another code."
- "Too many verification code requests. Please try again later."
