# Cleanup Summary

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. Removed Dark Mode Toggle
**Location:** `lfc-learning/src/pages/Student/ProfilePage.tsx`

**What was removed:**
- Theme toggle buttons (Light/Dark) from Preferences tab
- Theme selection UI and related handlers

**What remains:**
- Onboarding tours toggle (still functional)
- All dark mode CSS classes remain in components (for future implementation)
- Dark mode can still be implemented later without the toggle

---

### 2. Fixed Onboarding Modal Persistence

**Problem:** Modal kept appearing even after clicking "Finish" or "Skip", and would reappear on page refresh or navigation.

**Root Cause:** 
- The `UserProfile` interface didn't include `hasSeenOnboarding` field
- Profile state wasn't tracking whether user had seen onboarding
- No session-level safeguard to prevent re-showing

**Fixes Applied:**

#### A. Updated UserProfile Interface
```typescript
interface UserProfile {
  profilePicture: string;
  name: string;
  dateOfBirth: string;
  phoneNumber: string;
  maritalStatus: string;
  technicalUnit: string;
  profilePicturePreview?: string;
  hasSeenOnboarding?: boolean;  // ✅ Added
}
```

#### B. Load hasSeenOnboarding from Server
```typescript
const userProfile: UserProfile = {
  profilePicture: userData.profilePicture || "",
  name: userData.name || "",
  dateOfBirth: userData.dateOfBirth || "",
  phoneNumber: userData.phoneNumber || "",
  maritalStatus: userData.maritalStatus || "",
  technicalUnit: userData.technicalUnit || "All Courses",
  hasSeenOnboarding: userData.hasSeenOnboarding || false,  // ✅ Added
};
```

#### C. Update Profile State After Finish
```typescript
setProfile(prev => prev ? { 
  ...prev, 
  ...safeProfile, 
  hasSeenOnboarding: true  // ✅ Added
} : null);
```

#### D. Mark Onboarding as Seen on Skip
```typescript
const handleSkip = useCallback(async () => {
  try {
    const token = localStorage.getItem("token");
    if (token) {
      await fetch(`${API_BASE}/api/auth/seen-onboarding`, {
        method: "PUT",
        headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${token}` },
      });
      setProfile(prev => prev ? { ...prev, hasSeenOnboarding: true } : null);
    }
  } catch (err) {
    console.error("Error marking onboarding as seen:", err);
  }
  setShowOnboarding(false);
  setOnboardingDismissed(true);  // ✅ Session safeguard
}, [API_BASE]);
```

#### E. Added Session-Level Safeguard
```typescript
const [onboardingDismissed, setOnboardingDismissed] = useState(false);

// In useEffect
if (!isInitialLoading && profile && progress.dashboard && !onboardingDismissed) {
  if (!profile.hasSeenOnboarding) {
    setTimeout(() => setShowOnboarding(true), 500);
  }
}
```

#### F. Server-Side Logging
Added comprehensive logging to `seeOnboarding` endpoint to track when onboarding is marked as seen.

## How It Works Now

### Onboarding Flow
1. **First Login:** User sees dashboard tour (if enabled)
2. **After Tour:** Onboarding modal appears automatically
3. **User Actions:**
   - **Finish:** Saves profile data + marks `hasSeenOnboarding: true` + dismisses modal
   - **Skip:** Marks `hasSeenOnboarding: true` + dismisses modal (no profile save)
   - **Close (X):** Same as Skip

### Persistence
- `hasSeenOnboarding` flag is saved to database
- Flag is loaded with user profile on dashboard mount
- Modal only shows if `hasSeenOnboarding === false`
- Session safeguard prevents re-showing even if state gets confused

### Safeguards
1. **Database Level:** `hasSeenOnboarding` field in User model
2. **Profile State:** Tracked in local profile state
3. **Session Level:** `onboardingDismissed` flag prevents re-showing in current session
4. **Tour Dependency:** Modal only shows after dashboard tour completes

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Modal appears on first login (after tour)
- [x] Clicking "Finish" saves profile and dismisses modal
- [x] Clicking "Skip" dismisses modal without saving
- [x] Modal doesn't reappear after dismissal
- [x] Modal doesn't reappear on page refresh
- [x] Modal doesn't reappear when navigating away and back
- [x] Server logs confirm `hasSeenOnboarding` is being set
- [x] Dark mode toggle removed from profile page

---

## Server Logs

To monitor onboarding behavior:
```bash
tail -f /tmp/server.log | grep -i onboarding
```

You'll see:
```
=== MARK ONBOARDING AS SEEN ===
User ID: 67xxxxx
Onboarding marked as seen for user: user@example.com
hasSeenOnboarding: true
```

## Notes

- Dark mode CSS classes remain in place for future implementation
- Onboarding tours toggle still works in Preferences
- All profile update functionality is working correctly
- Cloudinary uploads are functioning properly
