# Assignments & Projects Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ NaN File Size Display
**Problem:** File sizes showing as "NaN MB" in submission modals

**Fix:** Added conditional rendering to only show file size if it's valid
```typescript
{file.size && !isNaN(file.size) && (
  <span className="text-sm text-gray-500 ml-2">
    ({(file.size / 1024 / 1024).toFixed(1)} MB)
  </span>
)}
```

**Files Modified:**
- `lfc-learning/src/components/Admin/AssessmentTabs/AssignmentSubmissionModal.tsx`
- `lfc-learning/src/components/Admin/AssessmentTabs/ProjectSubmissionModal.tsx`

---

### 2. ✅ Course Completion Not Updating
**Problem:** Course not marked as complete even after finishing all modules, assignments, and projects

**Root Cause:** After completing quizzes, the overall course progress wasn't being recalculated

**Fix:** Added automatic progress recalculation after quiz completion
```javascript
// Recalculate overall course progress
if (passed) {
  const { updateEnrollmentProgress: recalculateProgress } = await import('./progressController.js');
  await recalculateProgress(enrollment._id, courseId);
  console.log('✅ Course progress recalculated');
}
```

**File Modified:**
- `server/controllers/proctoringController.js`

**How It Works Now:**
1. Student completes quiz and passes (score ≥ 70%)
2. Module marked as complete in enrollment
3. Overall course progress automatically recalculated
4. Course marked as complete if all requirements met:
   - All modules completed
   - All assignments submitted and passed (≥ 70%)
   - Project submitted and passed (≥ 70%) if course has project

---

### 3. ✅ Assignments/Projects Showing for Non-Enrolled Users
**Problem:** Students could see assignments and projects from courses they weren't enrolled in

**Fix:** Filter to only show assignments/projects from enrolled courses

**MyAssignments.tsx:**
```typescript
// Get enrolled course IDs
const enrolledCourseIds = new Set(enrollments.map((e: any) => e.course?._id).filter(Boolean));

// Only show assignments from enrolled courses
const allAssignments: AssignmentWithProgress[] = courses
  .filter((course: any) => enrolledCourseIds.has(course._id))
  .flatMap((course: any) => ...);
```

**MyProject.tsx:**
```typescript
// Filter courses that have projects, are enrolled, and create project objects
const allProjects: ProjectWithProgress[] = courses
  .filter((course: any) => {
    const enrolledCourseIds = new Set(enrollments.map((e: any) => e.course?._id).filter(Boolean));
    return course.project && enrolledCourseIds.has(course._id);
  })
  .map((course: any) => ...);
```

**Files Modified:**
- `lfc-learning/src/pages/Student/MyAssignments.tsx`
- `lfc-learning/src/pages/Student/MyProject.tsx`

## Testing

### Test File Size Display
1. Go to Admin → Assessments
2. View any assignment or project submission
3. File size should either show correctly (e.g., "2.5 MB") or not show at all
4. No "NaN MB" should appear

### Test Course Completion
1. Enroll in a course
2. Complete all modules (pass all quizzes with ≥ 70%)
3. Submit and pass all assignments (≥ 70%)
4. Submit and pass project (≥ 70%) if course has one
5. Check enrollment progress - should show 100% and "completed: true"
6. Course should appear in "Completed" filter

### Test Enrollment Filtering
1. As a student, enroll in Course A
2. Don't enroll in Course B
3. Go to "My Assignments"
4. Should only see assignments from Course A
5. Go to "My Projects"
6. Should only see projects from Course A

## Course Completion Logic

### Weights
- **Modules:** 40%
- **Assignments:** 30%
- **Project:** 30%

### Completion Criteria
A course is marked as complete when:
1. **All modules completed** (or no modules exist)
2. **All assignments passed** with score ≥ 70% (or no assignments exist)
3. **Project passed** with score ≥ 70% (or no project exists)

### Progress Calculation
```javascript
const progress = Math.min(100, Math.round(
  (moduleProgress + assignmentProgress + projectProgress) * 100
));
```

### When Progress Updates
- ✅ After completing a quiz (module)
- ✅ After assignment is graded
- ✅ After project is graded
- ✅ Manual progress updates via API

---

## Monitoring

### Check Course Progress Recalculation
```bash
tail -f /tmp/server.log | grep "progress recalculated"
```

You'll see:
```
✅ Enrollment progress updated for quiz: 67xxxxx
✅ Course progress recalculated
```

### Check Enrollment Status
Query the database:
```javascript
db.enrollments.findOne({ user: userId, course: courseId })
```

Look for:
- `progress: 100`
- `completed: true`
- `completedAt: Date`
- `moduleProgress: [{ completed: true }, ...]`
- `assignmentProgress: [{ score: ≥70, graded: true }, ...]`
- `projectProgress: { score: ≥70, reviewed: true }`

## Notes

- File size is optional - if not available, it won't show (better than showing NaN)
- Course completion is now automatic after each quiz/assignment/project completion
- Students can only see assignments/projects from courses they're enrolled in
- Progress is recalculated in real-time, no manual refresh needed
- All changes are backward compatible with existing data
